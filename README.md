# QGdosBullsBOT
Project for the junior enterprise Opção Consultoria.

The purpose of this project is to develop a bot to be used on a junior enterprise Discord server.

Opção Consultoria is a junior enterprise of Economics college of the Fluminense Federal University, based in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
As technology advances and works in people's favor, Opção Consultoria members, aka 'bulls' (a symbol of economics), decided that was time to begin an automatization project to ease intern processes.

Discord, well-known platform, was chosen not just because of the bunch of features it offers, but also because of their non-complex use. In just a click of few buttons, you're able to give permissions to users, change their nicknames, divide topics by channel, etc. Even though Discord inner functions would supply our necessities, we feel like we can use it better. Instead of using the features mannually, why don't we automate it?

Automating it won't just help our company to grow, but also will develop students skills in programming, and preparing them to job market is the main purpose of a junior enterprise.

Please feel free to suggest and criticize - this is my first big project and surely I have loads of stuff to learn.
